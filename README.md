# Memory-card
A small test consisting of 20 questions, half of them has a topic: ancient Greek mythology, and the other half is related to me (the author of the project)
Earlier in the beta version, the questions went in order and at the end of the test you could see how many points you scored, but due to some changes at the moment the test is endless, and the questions can be repeated
